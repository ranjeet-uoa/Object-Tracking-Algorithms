# Object Tracking Algorithms
This repository stores the relevant codes and documents related to ``Object Tracking``
### Single Object
This branch looks at the tracking of a single maneuvering target using two filters: `CKF` and `PF.`
There are two folders for these filter implementations:
- `CKF_and_PF_for_maneuvering_target/`: It has a fixed method for filter initialization
- `CKF_and_PF_or_maneuvering_target_1/`: It can do the filter initialization with three methods
